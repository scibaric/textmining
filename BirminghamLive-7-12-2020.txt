Birmingham City's Alen Halilovic opens up about Barcelona, big mistakes and that Messi tag
Alen Halilovic has come to Birmingham City to put down roots, to end his time as a nomad and to become the player people expected him to be.
Anyone who has followed the Croatian’s career will know the story, one which began when he started setting records as a 16-year-old and one which eight years later has seen him play for nine different clubs.
In his first two professional games Halilovic became Dinamo Zagreb’s youngest ever player and then the Croatian league’s youngest ever goalscorer. Sound familiar?
He quickly earned the rather unhelpful epithet ‘The Croatian Messi’ - not helped by the fact he then joined the gilded Argentine at Barcelona just 18 months later.
If ever there was a footballing microscope the don’t come much more powerful.
“At some point for the first two or three years it was really difficult,” Halilovic admits.
“I changed my country, after my family went back to Croatia I was alone. It was a little bit tough for a young player – for that expectation.”
The plan was that Halilovic would spend a year playing with Barcelona B and he then made his first-team debut as a 20-year-old.
