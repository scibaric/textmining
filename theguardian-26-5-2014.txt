Barcelona confirm signing of Croatia wonderkid Alen Halilovic


Barcelona have signed the highly-rated teenager Alen Halilovic from Dinamo Zagreb on a five-year contract. The diminutive midfielder, who turns 18 in June, has moved for a fee thought to be around £1.8m.
Halilovic will initially join the Barcelona’s B team but is not expected to have to wait long for first team opportunities under the new manager, Luis Enrique. He has been compared to Lionel Messi and his countryman Luka Modric since making his Dinamo debut at 16 years and 101 days old, which made him the club’s youngest ever player. He scored seven goals in 44 appearances for the club.
The move was thought to be under threat in April when Barcelona were handed a two-window transfer ban after Fifa found them guilty of breaching rules relating to the transfer and registration of players under 18. However, the ban was suspended pending an appeal.
The signing is Barcelona’s second significant transfer of the summer after goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen completed a £10m move from Borussia Mönchengladbach.
